  Avatar Shaper is an easy-to-manage WordPress plugin that allows you to customize how to display user profile images. It allows you to add a unique taste to your blog. Avatar Shaper comes with an easy to use options panel to customize how you want your site's avatars to look like. You can customize the shape of the avatars by adjusting the radius of the borders. There are several preset positions to help you choose. If you would like to specify a custom shape you can choose custom and adjust the slider to a border radius that suits you. A preview of your current changes is displayed on an avatar to the right so you won't have to keep saving and trying out changes while your site is live. You also have the option to add a shadow to your avatars and change the color of the shadow to whatever you like by the color selector tool.
